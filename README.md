# Student Data Management System
-------------------------------

## Description
  -> The Student Data Management System is a web-based application built with Java and Spring Boot to manage student data efficiently. This system provides a set of RESTful APIs for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student information. It is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easily integrable with other systems, supporting educational institutions in managing student records.

## Features
- *Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations:* Manage student records easily with full CRUD functionality.
- *RESTful API:* All interactions are exposed through HTTP RESTful services for easy integration.
- *Spring Boot Framework:* Provides a rapid setup, configuration, and deployment environment for the application.
- *Java Persistence API (JPA):* Integrated for efficient database operations and management.
- *MySQL Database:* Robust and reliable relational database used for data storage and management.
- *Validation:* Input validation is handled at the API level using Hibernate Validator to ensure data integrity.
- *Scalable and Extensible:* Designed to be extended with new features or integrated with external services as needed.

## Tech Stack
- *Language:* Java
- *Framework:* Spring Boot
- *Database:* MySQL
- *Build Tool:* Maven
- *Testing:* JUnit 5, Spring Boot Test

## Getting Started
### 1) Prerequisites
1. *Java:* Ensure that you have JDK 11 or later installed. You can download it from the Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
2. *Maven:* Make sure Maven is installed for building the project. You can download Maven from the Apache Maven website.
3. *MySQL:* Install MySQL for managing the database. You can download it from the MySQL website. Ensure that you have created a database for the application.
4. *IDE:* A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VSCode can help you manage and run the project efficiently.

### 2) Setup

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/RudraPrasad07/School-Data-Management-System.git
    
2. *Navigate to the Project Directory:*
    bash
    cd School-Data-Management-System
    
3. *Configure Database:*
   Update src/main/resources/application.properties with your MySQL database details:
    properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
    spring.datasource.username=your_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    
4. *Build the Project:*

### 4) API Documentation
You can explore and test the APIs using Swagger (if integrated) or tools like Postman. Below is an example of a sample API request in Postman:

### Sample API Request

- *Method*: POST
- *URL*: http://localhost:8080/students

- *Body*:
json
{
    "name": "Name",
    "dob": "DOB",
    "gender": "Gender",
    "email": "Email",
    "password": "Password",
    "phoneno": "PhoneNumber"
}

### 5) Database Configuration
### Switching to MySQL

To use MySQL, update the application.properties file with the following configuration:

properties
# MySQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

### 6) Testing
 - *Run tests using the following Maven command:*
    bash
    mvn test
